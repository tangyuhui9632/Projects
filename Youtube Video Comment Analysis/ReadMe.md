# Youtube Comment Analysis
### Goal 
This project uses the datset from Trending YouTube Video Statistics from Kaggle. The analysis consists two parts:
1. Extract Business Insights from EDA and Feature Engineering
2. Generate possible popular Youtube Video Titles using LSTM model

### Dataset

YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. According to Variety magazine, “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note that they’re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year”. Top performers on the YouTube trending list are music videos (such as the famously virile “Gangam Style”), celebrity and/or reality TV performances, and the random dude-with-a-camera viral videos that YouTube is well-known for.

This dataset is a daily record of the top trending YouTube videos.It includes several months (and counting) of data on daily trending YouTube videos. The features include the category, video title, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count. To retrieve the categories for a specific video, find it in the associated JSON. One such file is included for each of the five regions in the dataset.

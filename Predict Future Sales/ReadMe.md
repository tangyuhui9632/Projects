# Predict Future Sales of a Russian Store

## Goal
The goal is to predict future sales of a Russian store. The dataset comes from Kaggle. The analysis is divided into three parts:
- Exploratory Analysis
- Predict with Time Series Models
- Predict with Deep Learning

## Dataset
The dataset comes from Kaggle: a time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, provided by one of the largest Russian firms - 1C Company. As the dataset is too large, readers who are interested in further investigation can download it from Kaggle.

## Achievement
Conduct experiments with time series data with deep learning(LSTM) and time series models. Based on analysis, I also provide suggestions and strategies to further increase revenue (copouns, seasonal sales etc)

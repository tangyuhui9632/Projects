## Goal
This is the final project for ANLY501. We try to find out how movie soundtracks affect the popularity of the movie using machine learning.

## Description of Data
We web-scripted soundtrack data from Spotify and movie data fom IMDb. We merged two dataset based on our interested columns and conducted data cleaning.
cleaned_data.csv is our final cleaned data ready for analysis.

## Result & Insights
1. People love drama and romance as a movie genre.
2. People may enjoy instrumental music in movies, which perhaps owes to the exaggerating “theatrical effects” created by strong instrumental songs in the movie. But they are less likely to go back home and listen them again.
3. The overall popularity of soundtracks are lower than our expectation which mean that the soundtracks cannot actually live without its movies. Study from the most popular soundtracks. Most of them are with low instrumentalness, which could suggests that for the over 20 percent movies who do not have a song with low instrumentalness or human voice, including maybe one song with lyrics would increase the chance that you have a very popular soundtrack that could help to reinforce your movie reputation.
4. People are always picky on movie ratings. Despite the fact that they would like to spend a lot of money in the theater and contribute to the movie gross. It is not easy for them to give a high score for a movie.
5. Love is the forever most frequent topic of all movie and soundtracks.
